<h1> what is an ux?</h1>
<p>
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.</br>
 This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.</br>

User experience (abbreviated as UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system.</br>
 The system could be a website, a web application or desktop software and, in modern contexts, is generally denoted by some form of human-computer interaction (HCI).
